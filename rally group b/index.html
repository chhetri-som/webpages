            <p>The Group B regulations fostered some of the fastest, most powerful, and most sophisticated rally cars ever built, and their era is commonly referred to as the golden era of rallying. However, a series of major accidents, some fatal, were believed to be caused by their outright speed. There was also a major lack of crowd control at events. After the death of Henri Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto in the 1986 Tour de Corse, the FIA banned the group from competing in the WRC from the following season, dropped its prior plans to introduce Group S, and designated Group A  </p>

                            <p>Unlike previous regulations, Group B offered minimal restrictions on design and allowed advanced engineering concepts. This sparked a race among manufacturers to produce the fastest and most technically advanced rally cars.<br>The result? Lightweight cars with massive turbocharged or supercharged engines capable of producing over 500 horsepower, sophisticated all-wheel-drive systems, and advanced aerodynamics that transformed the sport.</p>

                            <p>Numerous spectator and driver deaths throughout the series' history would come to a head at the Tour de Corse rally later that season, when driver Henri Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto were killed after their Delta S4 left the road. In two minutes chassis 211 was reduced to just the tubular structure. Just hours after the crash, FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre banned Group B cars from competition for 1987, marking the end of rally's most epic era. </p>

                                <p class="mb-0">Certainly, the deaths and safety concerns associated with Group B Rally racing played a significant role in the decision to cancel the category. Group B Rally, with its high-speed, high-powered cars and limited safety measures, proved to be a deadly combination. Here are a few tragic incidents that occurred in Group B:</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><b>1982 Corsica Rally:</b> In 1982, during the Corsica Rally, French driver Jean-Luc Thérier lost control of his Group B Renault 5 Turbo and crashed into the crowd, resulting in several injuries. This incident highlighted the inadequate safety precautions in place.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><b>1985 Tour de Corse:</b> At the Tour de Corse rally in 1985, British driver Mark Lovell lost control of his Ford RS200 and crashed into a tree. This accident resulted in the deaths of his co-driver Roger Freeman and a spectator.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0"><b>1986 Portugal Rally:</b> The most notorious and tragic incident occurred during the 1986 Portugal Rally. Portuguese driver Joaquim Santos lost control of his Ford RS200 and crashed into a crowd of spectators. Three people were killed, and more than 30 others were injured. This horrifying accident led to immediate scrutiny of Group B’s safety standards.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0">As a result, the FIA made the difficult decision to cancel Group B Rally in 1987. The category was disbanded due to its perceived dangers to both competitors and spectators. The cars were simply too powerful and fast for the safety measures and infrastructure of the time to handle. Group B’s cancellation marked the end of an era in rallying, but it was a necessary step to prioritize safety in motorsport.</p>
